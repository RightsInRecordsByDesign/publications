# Extract 

When you enter the out of home care system,your whole world is turned upside down. You are separated from your family and placed with either relatives, in foster homes with people you do not know or, supposedly as a last resort, in residential facilities. Known in Australia by the young people that experience it as ‘resi care’, these are group homes, run by placement agencies, where young people are cared for by a rotating shift of community support workers.
